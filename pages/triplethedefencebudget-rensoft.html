			<br /> The idle game where nukes are legal, affordable, and widely available!
			<br /> The year is 248XX.
			<br />
			<br /> At long last, the masses rejoice as world peace has been finally achieved. Citizens feast on
			bottomless
			<br /> bowls of ambrosia and Not Hheetos and live together in harmony. Puppies and kittens embrace in the
			streets
			<br /> and play with paraplegic children, growing and building a world of love for all.
			<br />
			<br /> However, in this idyllic world where war and conflict have been permanently set aside, there is one
			problem:
			<br />
			<br /> The rapidly plummeting defence budgets of nations across the globe!
			<br />
			<br /> Orders from the powers-that-be are clear: a slashed budget is unacceptable. But, in this new era of
			unending
			<br /> peace, how could you justify any amount of military spending?
			<br />
			<br /> You decide that you will save the budget in the only way you know how.
			<br />
			<br /> You book a flight to Neo-California. You bring your arsenal- the collective might of your nation-
			with
			you.

			<br /> Triple The Defence Budget is a submission for Winnipeg Game Jam 2025. Many thanks to the contributors
			on
			<br /> this project:
			<br />
			<br /> Hero67, who did the spritework for our lovable drinking bird and contributed several weapon concepts
			<br /> (including a few of my personal favorites);
			<br /> NovaDC, whose contributions to the game's title screen and various visual enhancements are
			innumerable
			and
			<br /> invaluable, who drafted the scene-setting piece you just read on this page, and who also threw wads
			of
			wet
			<br /> toilet paper on the ground for the sake of this game;
			<br /> rensoftworks, who smelled really weird throughout the entire weekend and didn't do anything that was
			very
			<br /> important.

			<br />
			<br /> This game is a work of fiction. Any similarities to real world entities, living, dead, or other are
			purely
			<br /> coincidental and not really our problem.
			<br />
			<br /> This game contains a LOT of flashing lights.
